<P>An autonomous car (also known as a &QUOT;driverless car&QUOT; and a self-driving car) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.Autonomous cars combine a variety of techniques to perceive their surroundings, including radar, laser light, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.The potential benefits of autonomous cars include reduced mobility and infrastructure costs, increased safety, increased mobility, increased customer satisfaction, and reduced crime. These benefits also include a potentially significant reduction in traffic collisions, resulting injuries; and related costs, including less need for insurance. Autonomous cars are predicted to increase traffic flow, provide enhanced mobility for children, the elderly, disabled, and the poor; relieve travelers from driving and navigation chores; lower fuel consumption; significantly reduce needs for parking space; reduce crime and facilitate business models for transportation as a service, especially via the sharing economy.This shows the vast disruptive potential of the emerging technology. This is further explained under the following sub-heads:</P>

<P><H2><u>Autonomous vs. automated</u></H2></P>
<P>Autonomous means self-governing.Many historical projects related to vehicle autonomy have been automated (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.</P>

<H2><u>Classification</u></H2>
<P>A classification system based on six different levels (ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems) was published in 2014 by SAE International, an automotive standardization body, as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems. This classification system is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle capabilities, although these are very loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a formal classification system,but abandoned this system in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. </P>
